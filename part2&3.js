// Essay Portion: LinkedIn has been a popular breach site for hackers since it was recently hacked twice within a decade of operation. I’m no expert in this matter but I’m assuming that’s a lot of attention from our hacker friends.  Looks like in 2012 a famous hacker breached LinkedIn and pulled about 6.5 million password details from the platform and posted it onto a Russian hacker site.  Offering email addresses and password, the hacker was hoping to come out of this event 5 bitcoins richer.  LinkedIn came out about the breach in 2016, 4 yrs later, acknowledging the breach and talking about their reset process. 

// The breach came from unsalted SHA-1 hashes, lack of firewall protection and overloaded database

// LinkedIn said it had reset the passwords of affected accounts. Looks like the world has been saved once again
